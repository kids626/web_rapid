<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Requesting clarification on the plan**

I need to implement a plan, but the user hasn't provided one. The query says, "Implement the following plan as specified," yet there's no plan attached. I should ask for clarification, but the instructions suggest I should act autonomously unless I'm completely blocked. Since I'm missing the plan details, it seems necessary to ask the user for more information. I could use a concise question in Chinese: 請貼上具體計畫... and also provide a checklist of what I need.
**Requesting details in Chinese**

I feel blocked in my process since I can’t create any todos until I have more information. I need to respond in Traditional Chinese and keep it concise. I could prepare a bullet list of the required details to ask the user. Since they mentioned implementing a plan, I'll clarify that I can start once I have it. It seems I should also include a status update to keep everything transparent, but since no tools are involved, I might focus just on the message clarity for now.
