<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Reviewing tooltip issues**

I need to open files to check the code for charts, configuration of tooltips, event handling, and potentially CSS issues that could hide tooltips due to z-index or overflow hidden containers. I'm also considering if Bootstrap tooltip might interfere, or if Chart.js tooltips are disabled. Another thought is whether pointer-events are blocked by CSS. I should read these files in parallel and keep track of my status as I go. Let’s figure this out!
**Preparing for tool calls**

I need to make sure our message includes a micro status update before making any tool calls. After reading the necessary files, I plan to analyze the information and propose a plan. If needed, I can also run a codebase search for further insights. It feels methodical to have this step-by-step approach, so I think I’m set to proceed with the reads. Let’s get started on this!</details></think>

我先快速查看 `resources/views/sales/report.blade.php`、`resources/views/sales/monthly.blade.php` 與 `app/Http/Controllers/SalesReportController.php`，找出圖表與 tooltip 的實作方式與可能衝突來源，接著提出精準改善方案與變更點。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating tooltip issues**

I’m pondering why the tooltip isn’t showing in the scroll container. It might be due to the custom plugin drawing text near the bar, which could overlap and affect pointer events. However, pointer events are only for the canvas. I know that Chart.js requires certain scripts and that common issues could stem from tooltips being disabled by the 'barValue' plugin. I need to clarify whether plugins like 'tooltip' draw before or after datasets to understand the issue better. The tooltip should still appear!
**Investigating tooltip and canvas issues**

I’m looking into a potential issue with Chart.js where a large number of bars and settings like 'indexAxis: y' might be causing an excessive canvas height. Even if the tooltip appears, it doesn't follow the pointer when scrolling since the canvas stays static relative to the viewport. The phrase "滑鼠移過去多無法正常顯示提示字框" suggests tooltip display problems, possibly linked to stacked bars or the use of jQuery slim version. Chart.js v4 has changed how tooltips and interactions are configured, which could be causing these complications.
**Analyzing Chart.js tooltip settings**

I’m digging into Chart.js v4 and its changes regarding interaction and tooltips. The 'interaction.mode' should now be defined under the root 'interaction' settings instead of the tooltip plugin, which no longer recognizes 'mode'. While 'plugins.tooltip' still retains options like 'enabled', it seems that 'mode' is ignored if set there. I think the default setting is 'nearest', which might not work well with narrow, thick bars, affecting tooltip visibility due to the requirement for intersections. This could explain the tooltip display issues I’m encountering.
**Fixing Chart.js tooltip settings**

I need to adjust the interaction settings by moving 'interaction' to options like this: { interaction: { mode: 'index', intersect: false, axis: 'y' } } for horizontal bars. There's also a performance note about overflow in the mobile 'chart-scroll' container, which is safe. The custom plugin value labels could overlap tooltips, but that’s manageable. It’s essential to check that the correct 'plugins.tooltip' is used because 'mode' should be under 'interaction' in v4. The existing code leads to tooltips not appearing unless directly over the dataset, causing the hover issues I’ve seen.
1. 請問是 `sales.report` 還是 `sales.monthly` 頁面？  
- a) 報表頁 `sales.report`  
- b) 月份彙總 `sales.monthly`  
- c) 兩者都有  

2. 問題是「完全沒有顯示」還是「偶爾顯示、要很準才出現」？  
- a) 完全不顯示  
- b) 偶爾顯示  
- c) 兩者不是/其他  

請幫我回答這兩個問題，以便我們能進一步擬定計畫。
## 需要確認

我已檢視兩個頁面的圖表初始化，發現 Chart.js v4 的互動設定被放在 tooltip 下，導致 hover 命中嚴格。接下來我會確認是哪個頁面、現象程度，然後提供精準編修。

### 代碼參考：
1. **report.blade.php**: lines 228  
   ```javascript
   plugins: { legend..., tooltip: { mode: 'index', intersect: false } }
   ```

2. **monthly.blade.php**: lines 137-140  
   ```javascript
   plugins: { tooltip: { mode: 'index', intersect: false } }
   ```

### 問題：
1. 請問是 `sales.report` 還是 `sales.monthly` 頁面？  
2. 問題是「完全沒有顯示」還是「偶爾顯示、要很準才出現」？</details></think>

我已檢視此頁與月份頁的圖表初始化，發現 Tooltip 互動參數被放在 `plugins.tooltip` 下；在 Chart.js v4 這些應該放到 `options.interaction`，否則常會需要「精準對準」長條才會顯示，導致提示框常常不出來。

以下是目前程式片段（可疑點）：
```228:228:resources/views/sales/report.blade.php
plugins: { legend: { display: true, labels: { font: { size: 12 } } }, tooltip: { mode: 'index', intersect: false } }
```
```137:140:resources/views/sales/monthly.blade.php
plugins: {
  tooltip: { mode: 'index', intersect: false },
  legend: { position: 'top' }
}
```

### 需要確認
1. 問題出在哪個頁面？
   - a) 報表頁 `sales.report`
   - b) 月份彙總頁 `sales.monthly`
   - c) 兩者都有
2. 現象是什麼程度？
   - a) 幾乎不會出現提示框
   - b) 偶爾出現（要很準才會出現）
   - c) 其他（請簡述）

我這邊打算把互動設定改為 `options.interaction = { mode: 'index', intersect: false, axis: 'y'| 'x' }`（橫條圖用 `y`，直條圖用 `x`），並保留 `plugins.tooltip` 其他設定。也會順便加上 `events` 以涵蓋滑鼠與觸控事件，讓提示框更穩定。回覆上面兩題後我就替你調整。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating code for charts**

I'm considering how to configure events like ‘mousemove,’ ‘mouseout,’ ‘click,’ and ‘touchstart.’ For updating the code in the `renderBarChart`, I need to include an interaction property, particularly focusing on `hover` settings. In Chart.js v4, the default behavior for tooltips is important. 

I also want to ensure that the `indexAxis` is set correctly with 'y.' I'll plan adjustments for monthly updates and provide a concise plan that outlines necessary changes to `report.blade.php` while ensuring the correct Chart.js version is loaded.
**Confirming the plan**

I need to ask the user to confirm the plan. They've provided input on the page and severity, so it’s time to propose the plan. Even though the markdown specifications suggest avoiding `#` headings, the create_plan tool requires the first line to be a level 1 title formatted with `#`. So, I'll have to navigate that inconsistency. 

The plan will include 2-3 tasks, such as updating the interaction configuration in `report.blade.php` for both `todayChart` and `yesterdayChart`, and possibly adjusting the hover plugin. I'll also contemplate including `maintainAspectRatio: false` as an option.
**Adjusting Chart.js options**

I’m planning to include a change to the `options.events` to incorporate pointer/touch events. While considering whether to set `clip: false`, it might not be relevant, so I’ll aim to keep the plan concise. I need to provide a short code snippet for the new options block.

I can cite specific file paths and snippets in my plans, but our rules say for existing code, we need references. So, to keep it straightforward, I’ll show just the new options snippet and mention the necessary lines to change. Let’s craft that plan:  
**Title:** Overview: Adjust Chart.js interaction to improve tooltip on the report page.  
Steps:  
1.
**Updating Chart options in the report page**

In the `report.blade.php`, I need to adjust the `renderBarChart` options. I’ll move `mode/intersect` into `options.interaction`, set `axis: 'y'`, and adjust `plugins.tooltip.position` to 'nearest.' If `tooltip.mode` and `tooltip.intersect` are present, I’ll remove those to prevent confusion.

I could provide a code snippet with line references from 222 to 230, but since the options object is long, I might keep it minimal. The new proposed configuration will specify `events` for Chart.js, ensuring that we implement these changes on the report page and potentially add a monthly update later. Let's create the plan and then confirm it with the user for approval.
**Including status updates**

I need to include a status update before making any tool calls. While the instructions for plan mode indicate that I shouldn’t run code, the developer guidelines require that I present status updates first. Since we're using the `create_plan` tool now, I want to provide a brief update about the current steps.

We've completed the previous task, and now I’ll proceed to present the plan for approval. It’s important to keep everything well communicated!</details></think>

---

我會調整 `resources/views/sales/report.blade.php` 的 Chart.js 設定，把互動參數改到 `options.interaction` 並設定 `axis: 'y'`、`intersect: false`，同時保留 `plugins.tooltip`、新增 `events`，以改善滑鼠移動時的提示框顯示穩定度。接著提交一個精簡的變更計畫請你確認。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing the Plan**

I need to implement the plan since the plan mode has ended, and I can make edits now. I'll be using tools from the functions namespace to update the report.blade.php chart options. The user mentioned that to-dos from the plan already exist, so I won’t create new ones. Instead, I’ll update the current to-do statuses: mark the first task as in progress, complete it after edits, and handle the second task similarly, while indicating that manual verification is necessary.
**Updating Status Before Tool Calls**

I need to ensure I have the correct status updates before making any tool calls. To modify the file, I’ll use the apply_patch function. I’ve recently read the report.blade.php file, and it contains the options block around line 228, which is essential for this update. However, apply_patch requires the exact context lines to match what's already there, so I need to be very careful about preserving whitespace and indentation while making these changes.
**Modifying Chart Options**

The code creates the chart configuration in the renderBarChart call, defining properties like type, data, labels, and options. I need to move the interaction settings to options.interaction and add an events property, specifically for the bar chart configured with indexAxis set to 'y'. I'll update the tooltip settings in the options by removing mode and intersect, and potentially add position set to 'nearest'. It's important to ensure I don't disrupt the formatting while making these changes.
**Creating a Diff for Chart Options**

I want to replace the current options in the chart configuration with new properties that include interaction, events, and tooltip position. It’s important to add axis 'y' as well since the events field should be a top-level property in the chart options, not within plugins. With Chart.js v4 having the 'interaction' property, I want to keep existing settings like 'responsive: true' and 'maintainAspectRatio: false'. After implementing the patch, I’ll consider running the linting tool on the modified blade file, even if it's optional.
**Planning the Patch and Tasks**

I see that the read_lints might return errors, but since I don't have a JS linter set up, it’s okay to skip it unless there are major code changes. The plan is to run read_lints on the modified report.blade.php file. Then, I’ll update the todo statuses. I’ll mark the first task as in progress, complete it after edits, and set the second task to in progress. Even though we can’t test interactively, we can provide manual verification steps for the user. 

Next, I need to craft the apply_patch for the options portion of the chart, ensuring I keep the formatting and context lines intact. Finally, I'll summarize the steps for verification and consider potential edits to the monthly.blade.php file based on the user's preferences.</details></think>

我已把報表頁的圖表互動設定調整完成，並檢查無新的 Lint 問題。接下來請你重新載入報表頁，用滑鼠在長條附近移動，看看 Tooltip 是否更容易顯示；觸控裝置也應該更穩定。

- 主要變更在 `resources/views/sales/report.blade.php` 的 `renderBarChart`：把 `mode/intersect` 從 `plugins.tooltip` 移到 `options.interaction`，設定 `axis: 'y'` 與 `intersect: false`，並新增 `events` 與 `tooltip.position: 'nearest'`。

若測試後仍覺得不夠敏感，我可以再加上 `hover` 參數微調或將 `interaction.mode` 調為 `'nearest'`。
